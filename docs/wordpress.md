<br />

This plugin provides full edge**mesh** support for the Wordpress platform.  It exposes a configuration page in the Wordpress admin area to add configuration options. The plugin is delivered ad hoc through our [releases]().

<br />

## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/edgemesh/edgemesh/releases/latest).
2. Upload `edgemesh-wordpress-plugin.zip` to your wp-admin [(instructions)](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins).
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Verify your origin on our [portal](https://portal.edgemesh.com).

ðŸš€ Thats it! Edge**mesh** is now enabled on your Wordpress site.  Deactivating or removing the plugin will remove edge**mesh** from your site.

<br />

## Configuration Options

The plugin is configured through `settings > edgemesh` in your Wordpress admin area. In most cases you will not need to touch these settings.

<br />

#### host `string`

If you are an enterprise customer, you will need to use these options to connect to your dedicated edge**mesh** backplane.

<br />

#### optIn `boolean`

Change edge**mesh** from `opt-out` mode to `opt-in` mode.  The edge**mesh** client will remain disabled until `edgemesh.optIn()` is called.  This will require you to add a dialog in your theme to prompt the user and decide wether or not to call `edgemesh.optIn()`.

<br />

## Runtime Methods

The running edge**mesh** client is attached to the `window` object.  The runtime can be accessed through `window.edgemesh` in your theme javascript or javascript console.  You can call any of the public methods listed below.  For instance, turn on the debug logging:

```javascript
window.edgemesh.debug(true)
```

You need to make sure you are on the correct context in dev-tools to issue commands.  Edge**mesh** resides in the `top` context.

<br />

#### debug ( `boolean` )

Set the debug output.

<br />

#### optIn ()

Opts current browser in to edge**mesh**. Used when `options.optIn` is set to `true`.

<br />

#### optOut ()

Opts current browser out of edge**mesh**. Used when `options.optIn` is set to `false`.

<br />

#### event(`object`)

Log a custom event to correlate with performance metrics.  The event is displayed in the edge**mesh** portal so you can see how page performance affects various aspects of your online business (product sales, signup conversion, etc).

The event method takes an object as its only argument:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UID       | String | Unique ID for event, could be a uuid, order number etc.      |
| type      | String | Type of the event, could be `signup`, `sale`, etc.           |
| name      | String | Arbitrary name associated with the event, could be a product name or user name, etc. |
| value     | String | Arbitrary value tied to event, could be an email, price etc  |

Results are aggregated in the `portal` by type and `name` fields. Here is an example of an event for a product being sold:

```javascript
edgemesh.event({
    UID: '#4321231',
    type: 'sale',
    name: 'Purple Shirt - SKU: 232334 ',
    value: '39.99'
})
```

<br />

#### clear()

Clears the edge**mesh** client cache. This method is useful for forcing a revalidation on the edge**mesh** backplane.

<br />

#### disable()

Disables the edge**mesh** client.  This method will unmount the service worker and prevent all edge**cache**, edge**secure** and edge**route** products from functioning.

<br />

#### enable()

Enables the edge**mesh** client.  This method re-registers the service worker and enables all edge**cache**, edge**secure** and edge**route** products.

<br />
